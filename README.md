# TotalRelationMatrix
A total relation matrix represents the total influence of factors on each other. It is calculated by adding up all the direct and indirect influences between factors. This data analysis practice helps us understand which factors are the most prominent and zero in on them. It also helps us understand which specific process could be slowing down the system or which one is contributing to its efficiency. To use this technique, we need two files: KPI and Input files. I will be uploading my files for reference.
For those new to data analytics, KPIs are Key Performance Indicators. They are quantifiable measurements that help us gauge the performance of the current system against goals. Depending on the purpose of your project, KPIs could include costs, time, quality, customer satisfaction, etc. I believe as an Analyst and an Engineer it is really important to KPIs when we are trying to improve a system or a process.
